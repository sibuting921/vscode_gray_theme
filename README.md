Gray theme files for visual studio code

VS Code theme with gray background which perfectly work with the "Default Light+" theme.
The reason for changing the background color from #ffffff to #dedede (to gray) is because LED displays have higher contrast, so this would be a good idea to change background color to deeper color if the light hurts your eyes.

## Setup

Download and replace settings.json file.

Windows VSCodium settings.json file path: "%appdata%\VSCodium\User\settings.json".


You can also customize your active Visual Studio Code color theme using the workbench.colorCustomizations user setting.

Go to Settings (ctrl+,), search for “color customizations”, select “Edit in settings.json” below Workbench: Color Customizations.

A settings.json file will be opened, you can edit it or replace it.
