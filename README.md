Theme files for visual studio code

VSCODE theme with gray background, which perfectly work with the"Default Light+" theme.
The reason for changing the background color from #ffffff to #dedede (to gray) is because LED displays have higher contrast, so this would be a good idea to change to deeper color if the light hurts your eyes.

## How
You can customize your active Visual Studio Code color theme with the workbench.colorCustomizations user setting.

Go to Settings (ctrl+,), search for “color customizations”, select “Edit in settings.json” below Workbench: Color Customizations.

A settings.json file will be opened.
